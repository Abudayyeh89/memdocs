    questions:

      - question: |
          When running a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment on a device, why isn't the device being added to the device group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy?
        answer: |
          - Verify that **Intune Autopilot ConfidentialClient** is set as the owner for the device group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md#create-a-device-group).

          - Verify that the correct device group is specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, see [Create a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#create-user-driven-microsoft-entra-join-windows-autopilot-device-preparation-policy) and [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md).

      - question: |
          When attempting to run a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment on a device, the Windows Autopilot device preparation experience never launches during the out-of-box experience (OOBE). Why doesn't the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment ever launch?
        answer: |
          - Verify that the minimum version of Windows is being used as documented in [Software requirements](requirements.md#software-requirements), including that the minimum required update is installed before starting the device for the first time:

            - Verify with OEMs that devices shipped from the OEM have the minimum required update installed.

            - If installing Windows from installation media, verify that the media has the minimum required update installed. Updated Windows installation media with the latest cumulative update already installed is available at the [Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/ServiceCenter/Default.aspx).

          - Verify that the device isn't registered as a Windows Autopilot device and that a Windows Autopilot profile isn't assigned to the device. Windows Autopilot profiles take precedence over Windows Autopilot device preparation policies. An indication that the device is registered as a Windows Autopilot device or that a Windows Autopilot profile has been assigned to the device is that the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) is displayed during OOBE. Windows Autopilot device preparation doesn't use the ESP. If a devices needs to be removed as a Windows Autopilot device, see [Deregister a device](../registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device)

          - Verify that the user signing into the device during OOBE is a member of the user group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, see [Create a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#create-user-driven-microsoft-entra-join-windows-autopilot-device-preparation-policy) and [Create a user group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-user-group.md).

          - Verify that a device group has been selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. A Windows Autopilot device preparation policy can be created without selecting a device group. For more information, see [Create a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#create-user-driven-microsoft-entra-join-windows-autopilot-device-preparation-policy) and [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md).

          - If using corporate identifiers in Intune, make sure that a corporate identifiers has been added for the device. For more information, see [Add Windows corporate identifiers](/mem/intune/enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add#add-windows-corporate-identifiers).

      - question: |
          Why are some of the applications or PowerShell scripts selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy not getting installed?
        answer: |
          - If in the details of the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment report, the applications or PowerShell scripts are showing **Skipped**, verify that the applications or PowerShell scripts are assigned to the device group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, see [Windows Autopilot device preparation policy configuration settings](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#configuration-settings) and [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md).

          - Verify that the application or PowerShell script is configured to install in the **System** context. Since the applications are installed and the PowerShell scripts ran during OOBE when no user is signed in, they must be configured to install in the **System** context.
