# Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join: Assign applications and scripts to device group

Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join steps:

- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](entra-join-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID](entra-join-allow-users-to-join.md)
- Step 3: [Create a device group](entra-join-device-group.md)
- Step 4: [Create a user group](entra-join-user-group.md)

> - **Step 5: Assign applications and scripts to device group**

- Step 6: [Create Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](entra-join-autopilot-policy.md)
- Step 7: [Add Windows corporate identifier to device (optional)](entra-join-corporate-identifier.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join workflow, see [Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join overview](entra-join-workflow.md#workflow).

## Assign applications and scripts to device group

Windows Autopilot device preparation allows deployment of up to:

- 10 managed applications
- 10 PowerShell scripts

during the out-of-box experience (OOBE) experience before the end-user is signed in for the first time. The applications and scripts specified should be the critical applications to install and critical scripts to run before the end-user can start using the device.

Any applications installed or scripts that run during a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment should be configured to install in the **System** context since the applications are installed and the scripts ran during OOBE when no user is signed in.

In order for applications to install and for scripts to run successfully, they must be assigned to the device group created for Windows Autopilot device preparation in [Step 3: Create a device group](entra-join-device-group.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The below steps assume that the applications to install or scripts to run during the Windows Autopilot device preparation have already been created. If they haven't been created, please see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add) and []() for more information on how to create them.

### Applications

To assign the desired applications and scripts to the device group created for Windows Autopilot device preparation:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. In the **Home** screen, select **Apps** in the left hand pane.

3. In the **Apps | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

4. In the **Windows | Windows apps** screen, scroll through the list of applications and then select the desired application that will be installed during the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment. Alternatively, use the **Search by name or publisher** box to search for the application, and then select it.

5. Once the application has been selected, a new screen will open showing the application. Under **Manage**, select **Properties**.

6. In the **Properties** screen, next to **Assignments**, select **Edit**.

7. In the **Edit application** screen:

   1. Under the **Required** section, select **+ Add group**. The **Select groups** pane opens.

   2. In the **Select groups** pane:

      1. Scroll through the list of groups. Once the Windows Autopilot device preparation device security group is located, select it. Alternatively, use the **Search** box to locate the Windows Autopilot device preparation device security group and then select it.

      2. Once the Windows Autopilot device preparation device security group is selected, select the **Select** button.

   3. Verify that the Windows Autopilot device preparation device security group is listed under the **Required** section. Additionally, verify that **Group mode** is set to **Included**. When applicable, also verify that **Install Context** is set to **Device context**.

   4. Once everything has been verified, select the **Review + save** button.

   5. In the **Review + save** screen, select the **Save** button.

8. Repeat the steps for any additional applications that need to be installed during the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment, up to the limit of ten applications.
