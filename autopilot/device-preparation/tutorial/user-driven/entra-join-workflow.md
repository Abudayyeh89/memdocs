# Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join in Intune

This step by step tutorial guides you through using Intune to perform a Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven scenario when the devices are Microsoft Entra joined.

The purpose of this tutorial is a step by step guide for all the configuration steps required for a successful Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join deployment using Intune. The tutorial is also designed as a walkthrough in a lab or testing scenario, but can be expanded for use in a production environment.

Before beginning, refer to the [How to: Plan your Microsoft Entra join implementation](/azure/active-directory/devices/azureadjoin-plan) to make sure all prerequisites are met for joining devices to Microsoft Entra ID.

## Windows Autopilot user-driven Microsoft Entra join overview

Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven Microsoft Entra join is a solution that automates the configuration of Windows on a new device without the need for IT intervention. Normally the device is delivered directly from an OEM or reseller to the end-user  Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven deployments use the existing Windows installation installed by the OEM at the factory. The end-user only needs to perform a minimal number of actions during the deployment process such as:

- Powering on the device.
- In certain scenarios, selecting the language, locale, and keyboard layout.
- Connecting to a wireless network if the device isn't connected to a wired network.
- Signing into Microsoft Entra ID with the end-user's Microsoft Entra credentials.

Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven deployments can perform the following tasks during the deployment:

- Joins the device to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Enrolls the device in Intune.
- Installs up to 10 critical applications.
- Runs up to 10 critical PowerShell scripts.

Once the Windows Autopilot device preparation user-driven deployment is complete, the device is ready for the end-user to use and they're immediately sent to the Desktop.
