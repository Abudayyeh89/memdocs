## Requirements

- Windows 11 23H2 with April CU or newer

## Process overview

When new Windows devices are initially deployed, Windows Autopilot Preparation uses the OEM-optimized version of Windows client. The OEM-optimized version of Windows client is preinstalled on the device, so custom images and drivers don't need to be maintained for every device model. Instead of re-imaging the device, with Windows Autopilot Device Preparation, the existing Windows installation can be transformed into a "business-ready" state that can:

- Configure apps and policies for a security group.
- Select apps and scripts to be installed during OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience).
- Assign the Windows Autopilot Device Preparation profile to users.
- Deliver Windows Autopilot Device Preparation configuration during user authentication in OOBE.
- Automatically add devices to the security group and receive selected apps and scripts assigned to the group.

After signing in, users are presented with a new status page in the Company Portal that:

- Displays compliance status and allows users to remediate.
- Shows the status of remaining required apps.
- Provides a clear indication that device setup is complete.
