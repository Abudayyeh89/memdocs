    questions:

      - question: |
          What is the most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID?
        answer: |
          The most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID is related to Microsoft Entra permissions. Make sure that [the correct configuration is in place](requirements.md?tabs=configuration) to allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID.

      - question: |
          Windows Autopilot device preparation experience never launches during the out-of-box experience (OOBE).
        answer: |
          - Verify that the minimum version of Windows is being used as documented in [Software requirements](requirements.md?tabs=software#software-requirements). This requirement includes that the minimum required update is installed before starting the device for the first time:

            - Verify with OEMs that devices shipped from the OEM have the minimum required update installed.

            - If installing Windows from installation media, verify that the media has the minimum required update installed. Updated Windows installation media with the latest cumulative update already installed is available at the [Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/ServiceCenter/Default.aspx).

          - Windows Autopilot device preparation doesn't use the Enrollment Status Page (ESP). Since Windows Autopilot device preparation doesn't use the ESP, the ESP shouldn't display during a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment. If the ESP displays during the deployment, then the device isn't running a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment. Instead, the device might be:

            - A Windows Autopilot registered device.
            - A Windows Autopilot profile is assigned to the device.

            Verify that the device isn't registered as a Windows Autopilot device and that a Windows Autopilot profile isn't assigned to the device. Windows Autopilot profiles take precedence over Windows Autopilot device preparation policies.

            If a device needs to be removed as a Windows Autopilot device, see [Deregister a device](../registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device).

          - Verify that the user signing into the device during OOBE is a member of the user group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information, see [Create a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#create-user-driven-microsoft-entra-join-windows-autopilot-device-preparation-policy) and [Create a user group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-user-group.md).

          - Verify that a device group is selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. A Windows Autopilot device preparation policy can be created without selecting a device group. For more information, see [Create a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-autopilot-policy.md#create-user-driven-microsoft-entra-join-windows-autopilot-device-preparation-policy) and [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md).

          - If using corporate identifiers in Intune, make sure that a corporate identifier is added for the device. For more information, see [Add Windows corporate identifiers](/mem/intune/enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add#add-windows-corporate-identifiers).

          - Verify that Windows automatic Intune enrollment is configured.

          - Verify that users are allowed to join device to Microsoft Entra ID.
