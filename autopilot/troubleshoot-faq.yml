  - name: Troubleshooting Windows Autopilot overview
    questions:
      - question: |
          What concepts should be understood when troubleshooting Windows Autopilot?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopilot is designed to simplify all parts of the Windows device lifecycle, but there are always situations where issues might arise. When troubleshooting an issue, it's helpful to understand:

            - The Windows Autopilot [process flow](#what-is-the-windows-autopilot-process-flow-).
            - How Windows Autopilot [device profiles](#how-are-windows-autopilot-device-profiles-downloaded-) are downloaded.
            - [Key activities](#what-are-the-key-activities-to-perform-when-troubleshooting-windows-autopilot-) to perform during troubleshooting.

      - question: |
          What is the Windows Autopilot process flow?
        answer: |
          Whether performing user-driven or self-deploying device deployments, the troubleshooting process is about the same. It's useful to understand the flow for a specific device:

          1. A network connection is established. The connection can be a wireless (Wi-fi) or wired (Ethernet) connection.

          1. The Windows Autopilot profile is downloaded. When a wired connection is used, or a wireless connection is established, the profile downloads from the Autopilot deployment service as soon as the network connection is in place.

          1. User authentication occurs. During a user-driven deployment, the user enters their Microsoft Entra credentials, which is then validated.

          1. Microsoft Entra join occurs. For user-driven deployments, the device is joined to Microsoft Entra ID using the specified user credentials. For self-deploying scenarios, the device is joined without specifying any user credentials.

          1. Automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment occurs. As part of the Microsoft Entra join process, the device enrolls in the MDM service configured in Microsoft Entra ID (for example, Microsoft Intune).

          1. Settings are applied. If the [enrollment status page](enrollment-status.md) is configured, most settings are applied while the enrollment status page is displayed. If not configured or available, settings will be applied after the user is signed in.

      - question: |
          How are Windows Autopilot device profiles downloaded?
        answer: |
          When an Internet-connected Windows device boots up, it attempts to connect to the Autopilot service and download an Autopilot profile. The Autopilot profile is downloaded as soon as possible, and again after each reboot.

          > [!NOTE]
          >
          > At this stage, it's important that a Windows Autopilot profile exists in the tenant so that a blank profile isn't cached locally on the device. If necessary, a new Windows Autopilot profile can be retrieved by rebooting the device.

          > 1. Select Shift-F10 to open a command prompt window.
          >
          > 1. In the command prompt window, enter one of the following two commands:

      - question: |
          What are the key activities to perform when troubleshooting Windows Autopilot?
        answer: |
          The key activities to perform when troubleshooting are:

          - Review configuration: Are Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Intune or a non-Microsoft mobile device management (MDM) service configured as specified in [Windows Autopilot configuration requirements](requirements.md?tabs=configuration)?

          - Check network connectivity: Can the device access the services described in [Windows Autopilot networking requirements](requirements.md?tabs=networking)?

          - Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) behavior: Are the [expected OOBE](#troubleshooting-windows-out-of-box-experience--oobe--issues-during-windows-autopilot) screens displayed? Is the Microsoft Entra credentials page customized with organization-specific details as expected?

          - Microsoft Entra join issues: Is the device able to [join Microsoft Entra ID](#troubleshooting-microsoft-entra-join-issues)?

          - MDM enrollment issues: Is the device able to [enroll in Microsoft Intune](#troubleshooting-windows-autopilot-device-import-and-enrollment) or non-Microsoft MDM service?

          - Review logs that are automatically collected upon Autopilot failure. For more information, see [Collect diagnostics from a Windows device](/mem/intune/remote-actions/collect-diagnostics). <!-- MAXADO-1895390 -->

      - question: |
          How can additional detailed troubleshooting information be enabled?
        answer: |
          On [Windows 11](/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client#windows-11-supported-versions), the Autopilot diagnostic page can be opened to view additional detailed troubleshooting information about the Autopilot provisioning process. To enable the Autopilot diagnostics page:

          1. Go to the [ESP profile](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status) where the Autopilot diagnostics page needs to be enabled.

          1. Make sure that **Show app and profile configuration progress** is selected to **Yes**.

          1. Make sure that **Turn on log collection and diagnostics page for end users** is selected to **Yes**.

          Once the diagnostic page is enabled, select the **View Diagnostics button** or enter the keystroke <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to access any diagnostic information. The diagnostics page is currently supported under the following conditions:

          - Windows 11.
          - Windows Autopilot user-driven mode.
          - When signing in with a Work or School account. Personal Microsoft accounts aren't supported.

          > [!NOTE]
          >
          > - By default diagnostics are automatically collected upon an Autopilot failure. For more information, see [Collect diagnostics from a Windows device](/mem/intune/remote-actions/collect-diagnostics).
          >
          > - For diagnostics to be able to upload successfully from the client, make sure that the URL `lgmsapeweu.blob.core.windows.net` isn't blocked on the network.

      - question: |
          Where does Windows Autopilot log to?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopilot logs entries into the event log. The log entries can be used to see details related to the Windows Autopilot profile settings and [OOBE](#troubleshooting-windows-out-of-box-experience--oobe--issues-during-windows-autopilot) flow. These entries can be viewed using Event Viewer. Review the information in Event Viewer at **Application and Services Logs** -> **Microsoft** -> **Windows** -> **ModernDeployment-Diagnostics-Provider** -> **Autopilot**.

      - question: |
          What do the different Event IDs mean in the Windows Autopilot event log entries in Event Viewer?
        answer: |
          The following events might be recorded, depending on the scenario and profile configuration:
          | **Event ID** | **Type** | **Message** |**Description** |
          |----------|------|-------------|-------------|
          | **100** | Warning | **Autopilot policy [name] not found.** | This error is typically a temporary problem, while the device is waiting for an Autopilot profile to be downloaded. |
          | **101** | Info | **AutopilotGetPolicyDwordByName succeeded: policy name = [setting name]; policy value = [value].** | This message shows Autopilot retrieving and processing numeric OOBE settings. |
          | **103** | Info | **AutopilotGetPolicyStringByName succeeded: policy name = [name]; value = [value].** | This message shows Autopilot retrieving and processing OOBE setting strings such as the Microsoft Entra tenant name. |
          | **109** | Info | **AutopilotGetOobeSettingsOverride succeeded: OOBE setting [setting name]; state = [state].** | This message shows Autopilot retrieving and processing state-related OOBE settings. |
          | **111** | Info | **AutopilotRetrieveSettings succeeded.** | This message means that the settings stored in the Autopilot profile that control the OOBE behavior were retrieved successfully. |
          | **153** | Info | **AutopilotManager reported the state changed from [original state] to [new state].** | Usually, this message says **ProfileState_Unknown to ProfileState_Available**.

      - question: |
          Where are the Windows Autopilot profile settings received from the Windows Autopilot deployment service stored?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopilot profile settings received from the Windows Autopilot deployment service are stored in the device's registry. This information can be found in the registry at the following registry key:

          `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Diagnostics\Autopilot`

          Available registry entries include:
          | **Value** | **Description** |
          |-------|-------------|
          | **AadTenantId** | The GUID of the Microsoft Entra tenant the user signed into. The user receives an error if this entry doesn't match the tenant that was used to register the device. |
          | **CloudAssignedTenantDomain** | The Microsoft Entra tenant the device is registered with, for example, `contosomn.onmicrosoft.com`. If the device isn't registered with Autopilot, this value is blank. |
          | **CloudAssignedTenantId** | The GUID of the Microsoft Entra tenant the device registered with. The GUID corresponds to the tenant domain from the CloudAssignedTenantDomain registry value. If the device isn't registered with Autopilot, this value is blank.|
          | **IsAutopilotDisabled** | If set to 1, this registry value indicates that the device isn't registered with Autopilot. This state could also indicate that the Autopilot profile couldn't be downloaded because of network connectivity or firewall issues, or network timeouts. |
          | **TenantMatched** | This entry is set to 1 if the user's tenant ID matches the tenant ID that the device was registered with. If this registry value is 0, the user would be shown an error and forced to start over. |
          | **CloudAssignedOobeConfig** | A bitmap that shows which Autopilot settings were configured. Values include: **SkipCortanaOptIn** = 1, **OobeUserNotLocalAdmin** = 2, **SkipExpressSettings** = 4, **SkipOemRegistration** = 8, **SkipEula** = 16 |

      - question: |
          Can ETW tracing be used with Windows Autopilot?
        answer: |
          ETW tracing can be used to get detailed information from Windows Autopilot and related components. The ETW trace files can be viewed using the Windows Performance Analyzer or similar tools. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Windows Autopilot](/archive/blogs/mniehaus/troubleshooting-windows-autopilot-level-300400).


  - name: Troubleshooting Windows Autopilot device import and enrollment
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why is error code "0x80180014" occurring when trying to re-enroll a device that has previously enrolled?
        answer: |
          Error code **0x80180014** can occur under either of the following scenarios:

          1. Microsoft Intune changed the Windows Autopilot self-deployment mode and pre-provisioning mode experience. To reuse a device, the device record created by Intune must be deleted.

              This change impacts all Autopilot deployments that use the self-deployment or pre-provisioning mode. This change impacts devices when they're reused, reset, or when redeploying a profile.

              To resolve and fix the issue in this scenario and redeploy the device using Windows Autopilot, follow these steps:

              1. Delete the device record in Intune. For the specific steps, see [Delete devices from the Intune admin center](/mem/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe#delete-devices-from-the-intune-admin-center).
              1. Redeploy the Autopilot deployment profile.

          1. Windows MDM enrollment is disabled in the Intune tenant.

              To resolve and fix the issue in this scenario and redeploy the device using Windows Autopilot, follow these steps:

              1. Sign into the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

              1. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left hand pane.

              1. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

              1. In the **Windows | Windows devices** screen, under **Device onboarding**, select **Enrollment**.

              1. In the **Windows | Enrollment** screen, under **Enrollment options**, select **Device platform restriction**.

              1. In the **Enrollment restrictions** screen, under **Device type restrictions**, select **All Users** under the **Name** column.

              1. In the **All Users** screen that opens, under **Manage**, select **Properties**.

              1. In the **Properties** screen that opens, next to **Platform settings**, select the **Edit** link.

              1. In the **Edit restriction** screen that opens:

                1. Locate **Windows (MDM)** under the **Type** column.

                1. Make sure that **Windows (MDM)** is set to **Allow** under the **Platform** column.

                1. If **Windows (MDM)** is set to **Block**, change it to **Allow**.

                1. Select **Review + save**, and then either **Save** if a setting was changed, or **Cancel** if not settings were changed.

              1. Repeat the above steps for any additional restrictions that might exist in the **Enrollment restrictions** screen other than **All Users**. Only restrictions for the **Windows** platform need to be verified.

              > [!NOTE]
              >
              > When multiple restrictions exist, restrictions might exist that only allow certain groups MDM enrollment. Some of the restrictions blocking MDM enrollment might be valid based on what group they're assigned to. When experiencing this problem, verify that the device isn't a member of one of the groups where there's MDM enrollment is blocked, or if applicable, change the MDM enrollment setting for that restriction to **Allow**.


          In both of these scenarios, in addition to error **0x80180014** occurring, the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logs might also show the following mobile device management (MDM) error:

          `MDM Enroll: Server Returned Fault/Code/Subcode/Value=(DeviceNotSupported) Fault/Reason/Text=(Enrollment blocked for AP device by SDM One Time Limit Check)`

      - question: |
          When trying to import a CSV file with a device hardware hash, why does nothing happen when selecting Import ?
        answer: |
          This issue usually occurs because the device hash in the CSV file is incorrectly formatted. The issue can be confirmed by running a network trace while the issue occurs. If an error **400** occurs in the network trace with the message body of

          `Cannot convert the literal '[DEVICEHASH]' to the expected type 'Edm.Binary'`

          then most likely the device hash in the CSV file is incorrectly formatted. Anything that corrupts the collected hash can cause this error. One possibility is that the hash itself fails to be decoded, even if the hash is valid.

          The device hash is Base64. At the device level, it's encoded as unpadded Base64, but Windows Autopilot expects padded Base64. Usually, the payload doesn't require padding and the process works. Sometimes, however, the payload doesn't line up cleanly and padding is necessary. In this case, the above error is displayed. PowerShell's Base64 decoder also expects padded Base64, so this decoder can be used to validate that the hash is properly padded.

          The "A" characters at the end of the hash are effectively empty data. Each character in Base64 is 6 bits. A in Base64 is 6 bits equal to 0. Deleting or adding **A**s at the end doesn't change the actual payload data.

          To resolve and fix this issue, the hash needs to be modified. The new value then needs to be tested until PowerShell succeeds in decoding the hash. The result is mostly illegible, which is fine as long as the the error **Invalid length for a Base-64 char array or string** isn't displayed.

          To test the base64, use the following PowerShell:

          ```powershell
          [System.Text.Encoding]::ascii.getstring( [System.Convert]::FromBase64String("DEVICE HASH"))
          ```

          As an example:

          ```powershell
          [System.Text.Encoding]::ascii.getstring( [System.Convert]::FromBase64String("Q29udG9zbwAAA"))
          ```

          This particular example isn't a device hash, but it's a misaligned unpadded Base64 so it's good for testing.

          Now for the padding rules. The padding character is "=". The padding character can only be at the end of the hash, and there can only be a maximum of two padding characters. Here's the basic logic.

          - Does decoding the hash fail?
            - Yes: Are the last two characters "="?
              - Yes: Replace both "=" with a single "A" character, then try again
              - No: Add another "=" character at the end, then try again
          - No: That hash is valid

          Looping the above logic on the previous example hash, we get the following permutations:

          - Q29udG9zbwAAA
          - Q29udG9zbwAAA=
          - Q29udG9zbwAAA==
          - Q29udG9zbwAAAA
          - Q29udG9zbwAAAA=
          - **Q29udG9zbwAAAA==** - This result has valid padding.

          Replace the collected hash with this new padded hash then try to import again.


      - question: |
          Why is the Windows Autopilot profile not applied after a hardware change occurred on a device?
        answer: |
          When a hardware change occurs on a device, the Windows Autopilot profiles isn't applied if a device is reimaged to a version of Windows prior to one of the following Windows versions:

          - Windows 11, version 21H2 with [KB5017383](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/september-20-2022-kb5017383-os-build-22000-1042-preview-62753265-68e9-45d2-adcb-f996bf3ad393).
          - [Windows 10, versions 22H2](/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client#windows-10-supported-versions).

          This behavior is expected.

          The message **Fix pending** or **Attention required** might also be displayed in the **Windows Autopilot devices** page for the device, which indicates that there was a hardware change on the device. When the link for the **Fix pending** status is selected, the following message appears:

          `We've detected a hardware change on this device. We're trying to automatically register the new hardware. You don't need to do anything now; the status will be updated at the next check in with the result.`

          To resolve and fix this issue, deregister and re-register the device. For more information including how to deregister a device, see the following articles:

          - [Deregister a device](registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device).
          - [Return of key functionality for Windows Autopilot sign-in and deployment experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/return-of-key-functionality-for-windows-autopilot-sign-in-and/ba-p/3583130).

        # MAXADO-8911669

      - question: |
          Why is the join type for a device showing as "Microsoft Entra registered" instead of "Microsoft Entra joined"?
        answer: |
          This issue occurs if the device was previously registered in Microsoft Entra ID before it was joined to Microsoft Entra ID. The device could've registered in Microsoft Entra ID via something like a [Workplace join](/entra/identity/devices/concept-device-registration). If the Microsoft Entra ID registered device isn't deleted from Microsoft Entra ID before it's joined to Microsoft Entra ID, then the previous trust type is retained in the record. Joining an existing Microsoft Entra registered device to Microsoft Entra ID results in the Windows Autopilot device showing as **Microsoft Entra registered** instead of **Microsoft Entra joined**.

          To resolve and fix this issue, before registering an existing Microsoft Entra ID registered device as Windows Autopilot device, make sure that any existing Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Entra ID, and Windows Autopilot device objects for the device are deleted. After all device objects are deleted, re-register the device as a Windows Autopilot device and then re-enroll the device. For more information on properly deleting all of the device objects, see [Deregister a device](registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device).

      - question: |
          Why is enrollment in Microsoft Intune or a non-Microsoft MDM solution failing with an error code "80180018"?
        answer: |
          To troubleshoot enrollment issues in Microsoft Intune such as the error code **80180018** in the **Something went wrong** error page, see [Troubleshooting Windows device enrollment errors in Intune](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/device-enrollment/troubleshoot-windows-enrollment-errors). Common issues can include:

          - Incorrect or missing licenses assigned to the user.
          - Too many devices enrolled for the user.

      - question: |
          Why does Windows Autopilot Reset fail immediately with an error?
        answer: |
          See [Troubleshoot Autopilot Reset](/education/windows/autopilot-reset#troubleshoot-autopilot-reset) for more help if Autopilot Reset fails immediately with the error:

          `Ran into trouble. Please sign in with an administrator account to see why and reset manually.`


  - name: Troubleshooting Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) issues during Windows Autopilot
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why is the Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) not running as expected during?
        answer: |
          It's useful to check if the device received a Windows Autopilot profile. If the device did receive a Windows Autopilot profile, verify that the settings in the profile are correct.

      - question: |
          What is the cause of the error message "Can't connect to the URL of your organization's MDM terms of use."?
        answer: |
          Licensing issues are usually associated with the error message:

          `Something went wrong`

          `Can't connect to the URL of your organization's MDM terms of use. Try again, or contact your system administrator with the problem information from this page.`

          Verify that the user who is signing into the device has a valid Intune, EMS, or Microsoft 365 license.


  - name: Troubleshooting Microsoft Entra join issues
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is the most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID?
        answer: |
          The most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID is related to Microsoft Entra permissions. Make sure that the correct configuration is in place to allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Configuration requirements](requirements.md?tabs=configuration).

      - question: |
          What happens if a user attempts to join more devices to Microsoft Entra ID than they are allowed?
        answer: |
          Errors can happen if a user exceeds the number of devices that they're allowed to join. This default limit is 50 devices but can be configured in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Understand Intune and Microsoft Entra device limit restrictions](/mem/intune/enrollment/device-limit-intune-azure).

      - question: |
          Why did deleting a device's object in Microsoft Entra ID cause the device to not be able to join Microsoft Entra ID any longer?

          A Microsoft Entra device is created upon import. It's important this object isn't deleted. The object acts as Windows Autopilot's anchor in Microsoft Entra ID for group membership and targeting, including the profile. Deleting it might lead to Microsoft Entra join errors. If this object is deleted, the issue can be fixed by deleting and reimporting the device as a Windows Autopilot device. Deleting and reimporting the device as a Windows Autopilot device will recreate the associated object in Microsoft Entra ID.
