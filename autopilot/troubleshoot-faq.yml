      - question: |
          What is the most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID?
        answer: |
          The most common issue joining a device to Microsoft Entra ID is related to Microsoft Entra permissions. Make sure that [the correct configuration is in place](requirements.md?tabs=configuration) to allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID.

      - question: |
          What happens if a user attempts to join more devices to Microsoft Entra ID than they are allowed?
        answer: |
          Errors can happen if a user exceeds the number of devices that they're allowed to join. This default limit is 50 devices but can be configured in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Understand Intune and Microsoft Entra device limit restrictions](/mem/intune/enrollment/device-limit-intune-azure).

      - question: |
          Why did deleting a device's object in Microsoft Entra ID cause the device to not be able to join Microsoft Entra ID any longer?
        answer: |
          A Microsoft Entra device is created upon import. It's important this object isn't deleted. The object acts as Windows Autopilot's anchor in Microsoft Entra ID for group membership and targeting, including the profile. Deleting it might lead to Microsoft Entra join errors. If this object is deleted, the issue can be fixed by deleting and reimporting the device as a Windows Autopilot device. Deleting and reimporting the device as a Windows Autopilot device will recreate the associated object in Microsoft Entra ID.
