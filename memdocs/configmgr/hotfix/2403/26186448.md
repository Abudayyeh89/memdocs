## Issues that are fixed
<!-- 9199873 -->
- The 256-bit AES block encryption algorithm (CALG_AES_256) and Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm (CALG_ECDH) are supported starting with this release. The 128-bit AES block encryption (CALG_AES_128) and RSA public key exchange algorithm (CALG_RSA_KEYX) are removed. 
These changes improve support for environments using the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

<!-- 15990439 -->
- Redundant storage checks are removed from the package transfer manager component, which increases the efficiency of transferring content to a cloud management gateway.

<!-- 16323943 -->
- A task sequence now retries if the following error message is encountered in the smsts.log file.
   ```text
   Failed to create an instance of COM progress UI object. Error code 0x8000401a
   ```

   ```

- Multiple accessibility improvements are made to Software Center.

<!-- 21209172 -->

- A task sequence fails if the Install Dynamic Software action is used for multiple packages, and the source version of one of those packages changes while the task sequence is running.

<!-- 24363755 -->
