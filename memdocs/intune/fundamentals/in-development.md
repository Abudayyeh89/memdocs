# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies now provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->

Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device configuration

### New BIOS device configuration profile for OEMs<!-- 9278502  -->

There will be a new **BIOS configuration and other settings** device configuration policy for OEMs. OEMs can use this new policy to enable or disable different BIOS features that secure device. In the Intune device configuration policy, you add the BIOS configuration file, and then assign the policy to your devices.

For example, admins can use the [Dell Command tool](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000108963/how-to-use-and-troubleshoot-dell-command-update-to-update-all-drivers-bios-and-firmware-for-your-system) (opens Dell's website) to create the BIOS configuration file. Then, they add this file to the new Intune policy.

**Declarative Device Management (DDM) > Passcode**:

### The macOS Company Portal app will support platform SSO (public preview)<!-- 24325427  -->

In Intune, you can configure the Enterprise SSO plug-in on Apple devices using a device configuration profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings Catalog** for profile > **Authentication** > **Extensible Single sign-on (SSO)**).

The Company Portal app version will support the platform SSO settings for macOS 13 and later. Platform SSO allows you to sync your Microsoft Entra ID password to local accounts on Macs using the Enterprise Single Sign-On extension.

For more information on the Enterprise SSO plug-in, see:

- [Use Intune to deploy the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md)
- [Microsoft Entra ID and the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in overview for Apple devices](/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin)

Applies to:

- macOS 13 and later

## Device management

### End-user access to BitLocker Recovery Keys for enrolled Windows devices<!-- 8077173 -->

End-users will be able to view the BitLocker Recovery Key for enrolled Windows devices in the Web Company Portal. This capability will reduce helpdesk calls in the event they get locked out of their corporate machines. End users can access their enrolled Windows device's Recovery Key by clicking on **View Recovery Key** under their device after logging into the Web Company Portal. This is a similar experience to the MyAccount website, which allows end users see their recovery keys as well.

Access to BitLocker recovery keys by end-users can be prevented when not allowed within your organization by using the Microsoft Entra ID toggle **Restrict non-admin users from recovering the BitLocker key(s) for their owned device**. For more information about how to prevent access to BitLocker recovery keys, see [Manage device identities using the Microsoft Entra admin center](/entra/identity/devices/manage-device-identities).

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device security

### Defender for Endpoint security settings support in government cloud environments<!-- 24191406  -->

Customer tenants in US Government Community (GCC) High, and Department of Defense (DoD) environments will soon be able to use Intune to manage the Defender security settings on the devices youâ€™ve onboarded to Defender without enrolling those devices with Intune. This capability is known as [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md).

For more information about the Intune features supported in GCC High and DoD environments, see [Intune US Government service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

  Applies to the following when you use the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform:
  - Windows 10
  - Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Intune support of Microsoft 365 remote application diagnostics<!-- 17409991  -->

The Microsoft 365 remote application diagnostics will allow Intune admins to request Intune App Protection logs and Microsoft 365 application logs (where applicable) directly from the Intune console. Admins will find this report in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Troubleshooting + support** > **Summary** > *App protection**.

 This feature is exclusive to applications that are under Intune App Protection management. If supported, the application specific logs are gathered and stored within dedicated storage solutions for each application. Outlook mobile logs will be supported in version 2404, with support for additional applications coming soon.
