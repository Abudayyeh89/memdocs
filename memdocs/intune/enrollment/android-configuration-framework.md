# Android Enterprise security configuration framework

The Android Enterprise security configuration framework is a series of recommendations for device compliance and configuration policy settings. These recommendations help you tailor your organization's mobile device security protection to your specific needs, and include: 

* Device enrollment restrictions for personally owned work profile. 
* App configuration policies for fully managed devices.  
* Basic and high-level security settings for personally owned work profile. 
* Basic, enhanced, and high-level security settings for fully managed devices. 

The security framework provides recommendations for the following Android Enterprise management solutions:

- Fully managed: Corporate-owned devices, associated with a single user, used exclusively for work and not personal use.  
- Personally-owned work profile and corporate-owned work profile: User-owned devices, for BYOD scenarios, creates clear boundary between work and personal data on device.  

## Deployment methodology  

[!INCLUDE [framework methodology](../includes/framework-deployment-methodology.md)]

When testing changes to Android Enterprise devices, be aware of the [delivery timing](../configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot.md#policy-refresh-intervals). The status of compliance policies for devices can be monitored. For more information, see [Monitor Intune device compliance policies](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) and [Monitor device profiles in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-profile-monitor.md).
